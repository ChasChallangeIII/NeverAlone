# Group Contract: Chas Challenge 2025

## Purpose:
This group contract has been created collectively to ensure a good working environment where we collaborate effectively, respect each other, and achieve our goal.

## Group Name: 

## Rules and Values  
- We respect each other's opinions and actively listen to one another.  
- We provide constructive feedback and avoid negative criticism without solutions.  
- We maintain a professional tone and treat each other with kindness and respect.  
- We are punctual for meetings and notify the group if we are late or unable to attend.  
- We respect each other's time.  
- In case of illness, we inform the group as early as possible.  
- If conflicts arise, we handle them through open and transparent discussions. If we cannot find a solution, we seek help from the school.  

## Communication  
- Our primary communication platform is Discord.  
- Important decisions and updates will be documented on GitHub.  
- If someone is not communicating, we try to contact them directly. If this fails after multiple attempts, we make a collective decision on how to proceed.  

## Ambition Level  
- Our main priority is to learn as much as possible during the project, striving to learn from one another and benefit from each other's experiences and knowledge.  
- We aim to win Chas Challenge and deliver a well-functioning product with high quality and strong development potential (a scalable product).  
- We strive to have fun together and create a positive experience from the project!
