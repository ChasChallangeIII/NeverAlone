# API Documentation â€“ NeverAlone

This project uses a REST API to manage user authentication, incident reports, comments, groups, and community features.

Since our team did not work directly on the API/backend, please refer to the official documentation written by the fullstack-team:

ðŸ”— **Full API Reference (GitHub)**:  
https://github.com/ChasChallangeIII/NeverAlone/tree/main/server#readme

This includes:
- Endpoint list and methods (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.)
- Authentication and JWT setup
- Environment variables and setup
- Route structure for reports, comments, users, and groups

> All endpoints require Bearer token authentication unless otherwise noted.
