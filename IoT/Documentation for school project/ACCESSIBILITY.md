# Accessibility – NeverAlone

## Current State

At this stage of the project, no specific accessibility features have been implemented. The primary focus has been on core functionality — connecting the IoT button to the mobile app, simulating a call, and submitting safety reports.

## Future Plans

We recognize the importance of accessibility in public safety tools and plan to improve inclusivity in future versions. Some areas we aim to address:

### IoT Button
- **Haptic Feedback:** Replacing or complementing the current LED indicator with vibration for users with visual impairments.
- **Audible Signals:** Optionally enable a sound notification when the button is pressed for better feedback.
- **Tactile Design:** Make the physical button more distinguishable by touch, possibly with textured materials.


## Accessibility Goals

Our long-term goal is to make NeverAlone usable by as many people as possible, regardless of physical ability. This includes:
- Users with visual, hearing, or motor impairments
- People with cognitive differences
- Older adults with limited tech experience

We welcome feedback on how we can better support accessibility in the future.
