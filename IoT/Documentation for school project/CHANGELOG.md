# Changelog – NeverAlone

This changelog documents major adjustments made to the project during development.

## [Unversioned] – Mid-Project Scope Change

### Changed
- Project scope and feature set were updated mid-way through the project.
- The original plan included more advanced IoT hardware features, but delays in hardware delivery required a pivot.
- Adjustments were made to the prototype requirements to focus on core features:
  - Simulated call via BLE-triggered event
  - Basic feedback through LED instead of haptic motor
  - Offline event storage implemented as a fallback

### Reason
- Hardware (battery, vibration motor and more) was not delivered in time, which prevented early testing and feature development.
- As a result, the team prioritized a working end-to-end prototype with BLE communication and basic interaction flow.

## Notes
- No formal versioning system (e.g. v1.0.0) was used in this project.
- Future iterations may adopt semantic versioning once a stable release is reached.
