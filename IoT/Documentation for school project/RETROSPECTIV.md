# Retrospective – NeverAlone (Chas Challenge 2025) - SUVX

## What Went Well

- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Our collaboration with the other teams worked smoothly. Since the hardware part of the project had to be scaled down due to hardware delivery delays, we had more time on our hands and thus were able to jump in and support where needed, and even contributed additional functionality such as building the Android APK. This cross-functional work was both rewarding and educational.
  
- **Delivering an Integrated System**: Despite setbacks, we managed to deliver a fully integrated product, from the IoT prototype, through the mobile app, to the backend. This was a major achievement considering the obstacles we faced.

- **Valuable Learning Experience**: Working with embedded systems, Bluetooth Low Energy and mobile development in React Native gave us exposure to a wide range of technologies and real-world challenges.
  
- **Learning by Doing**: We have expanded our skills, whether in embedded programming, mobile development, or working with BLE.  

- **User-Centered Idea**: The project concept, helping people feel safer in public spaces, motivated us and felt meaningful.

##  What Didn’t Go So Well

- **Hardware Delivery Delays**: We encountered serious issues with delayed hardware deliveries. Had we known this in advance, or been allowed to get the hardware ourselves, we would have structured and scoped the project differently from the start. This limitation caused frustration and affected team morale.

- **Downscaling and Re-scoping**: Our original vision for the project was more ambitious, but due to hardware constraints and time limitations, we had to rescope and scale down our goals. While necessary, this was demotivating as we had to let go of parts of our initial concept.

- **Unclear Project Planning**: Our internal project plan and division of responsibilities could have been more clearly defined from the beginning. This would have helped us work more efficiently and make better use of our time.

- **Integration Challenges Across Teams**: In the early phases, collaboration between teams (e.g., app and backend) lacked alignment. Variable formats and expectations were not clearly defined early on, which caused friction and confusion later in the project.

## Lessons Learned

- How to work with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) on both embedded and mobile platforms.
- Real-world tech projects require flexibility. Unexpected external factors (like hardware logistics) can have a big impact, and being able to adapt is key.
- Clear responsibility structures and early alignment between all project teams are essential, especially when multiple groups are working on interconnected systems.
- Even within a limited scope, it’s possible to build and deliver something meaningful and functional through teamwork and persistence.

We’re proud of what we achieved under the circumstances and we now have firsthand experience of what it means to take a project from just hardware to at least a viable prototype.
