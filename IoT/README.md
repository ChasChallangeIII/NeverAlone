# NeverAlone IoT Button

The **NeverAlone IoT Button** is a compact and discreet ESP32-based device that enhances personal safety in public spaces. With a single press, it sends a BLE signal to a paired mobile device, triggering a simulated call. It features haptic feedback, offline logging, and low-power design, and integrates seamlessly with the NeverAlone mobile app.

This repository contains the firmware for the button, written in C++ and built using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
