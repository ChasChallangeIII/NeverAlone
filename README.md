# **Never Alone** – Chas Challenge 2025

## **Project Overview**
Never Alone is a smart safety solution designed to help individuals feel more secure in public spaces. By pressing a discreet IoT button, users trigger an incoming call simulation, making them appear occupied. They can later fill out a survey in the mobile app to describe why they felt unsafe. Anonymized data can be shared with municipalities to improve urban safety measures.

## **Features**
- **One-Tap Safety** – Press the button to receive a simulated call and appear busy.
- **Survey Submission** – Users will fill in surveys at a later time explaining why they pressed the button.
- **Data Insights** – The survey reports help municipalities identify unsafe areas.
- **Cross-Platform App** – Available on mobile devices with a clean and intuitive UI.
- **IoT-Enabled Button** – Physical hardware integration for seamless interaction.
- **Real-Time Data Sharing** – Municipalities and organizations can access statistical reports on unsafe areas.
- **Customizable Notifications** – Users can set up emergency contacts for additional security.
- **Offline Functionality** – The button works even without internet access, sending data once connected.
